# FlappyPikachu
-- Hao Zhang

* Use arrow keys to control Pikachu, click mouse to select/unselect a pokemon on ground

* Pokemons evaluate when two of the same type are selected

* Pikachu evaluates to Raichu after getting 5 pokemons evaluated

* Pikachu can only hit a pokeball by its head (mouse) while Raichu can hit by anywhere

* Game over when there are more than 15 pokemons in windows

* There's Easter egg after evaluating to Raichu ;)

Good luck
